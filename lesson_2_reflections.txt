What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the .git file that is necessary because otherwise we couldn't keep the system control of the project or folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate connection between working directory and the repository. It "saves" the files that we want to track but it isn't the same as a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Because you can compare between the staging area and the last commit, so you can be sure that the last change is logical.
