What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the .git file that is necessary because otherwise we couldn't keep the system control of the project or folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate connection between working directory and the repository. It "saves" the files that we want to track but it isn't the same as a commit.
