When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It can help when you're working with other people. Also when you won't be working on your computer all the time

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you don't know what this changes can make into your program
